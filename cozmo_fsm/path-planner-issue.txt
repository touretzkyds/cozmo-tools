RRT planner should not try to use doorways as maneuverable space.  Use
wavefront for doorway passage.  Instead of giving the doorways wider
openings when RRT planning, we should block them off.

Wavefront planner is failing when a sideways cube is close to the
wall, even if there is room for the robot to fit.  Perhaps walls are
being inflated too thick?

Should we restrict the RRT algorithm to a smaller box, since we only
use it for short-range planning now?  This might help prevent it from
exceeding max_iter by exploring areas far from the robot and the goal.

DriveContinuous should turn more slowly when the robot is carrying a
cube, because it tends to overshoot.

In CalypsoMachine.fsm, in the first line of the ExpressFrustration
fsm, change =N=> to => and you'll get an error from genfsm that
reports the wrong line as the location of the syntax error.
