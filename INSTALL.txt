Ubuntu Linux:
1. For OpenGL you will need to do:
     apt-get install freeglut3
2. To get speech recognition to work:
     apt-get install python3-pyaudio
3. You can then install all required Python packages by doing:
     pip3 install -r requirements.txt
4. You will also need to install adb:
     apt-get install android-tools-adb
5. To get simple_cli to work, add the cozmo-tools directory to your PATH.


Windows:
1. The requirements.txt file lists all the packages you can install with pip, except
   for PyOpenGL. As of 2020 the PyOpenGL and PyOpenGL_accelerate packages in PyPI
   were not good. Instead, download their whl files for your Python version from
     https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyopengl
   and use pip to install them.
2. If you are using an Android device or a Kindle Fire to run the Cozmo app, you
   will also need to install adb. Follow the instructions on this page:
      http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/adb.html
3. If you are using an iOS device to run the Cozmo app you must install iTunes on
   your Windows computer so that you get the proper device drivers. Make sure
   that iTunes can talk to your iOS device before proceeding.
4. To get simple_cli and genfsm to work, add the following to your $Profile:
   function simple_cli() { py -i C:\Users\<username>\...\cozmo-tools\simple_cli }
   function genfsm($file) { py C:\Users\<username>\...\cozmo-tools\genfsm $file }
5. To allow Python to find the cozmo_fsm package, edit your user enviornment
   variables and create a new variable called PYTHONPATH that points to the
   cozmo-tools folder.


MacOS (should be 10.13 or higher):
1. The requirements.txt file will work for for everything but PyAudio.
   The version of PyAudio in PyPI does not compile unless you have
   certain tools installed.  Visit this page to learn how to install PyAudio:
     http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/
2. To use OpenGL you need to install freeglut, which can be done with the
   command 'brew install freeglut'. If your system doesn't have the "brew"
   command, visit this page: https://brew.sh/
3. If you are using an Android device to run the Cozmo app, you will need to
   install adb. Follow the instructions on this page:
     http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/adb.html
4. If you are using an iOS device to run the Cozmo app you don't need to
   install anything extra on your MacOS system.
5. To get simple_cli to work, add cozmo-tools to your PATH, and change the first
   line of simple_cli to include the correct path to your Python.
